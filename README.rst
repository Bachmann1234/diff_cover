===============================================================================

Automatically find diff lines that need test coverage.
Also finds diff lines that have violations (according to tools such as pep8,
pyflakes, flake8, prospector, or pylint).
This is used as a code quality metric during code reviews.

Overview
--------

Diff coverage is the percentage of new or modified
lines that are covered by tests.  This provides a clear
and achievable standard for code review: If you touch a line
of code, that line should be covered.  Code coverage
is *every* developer's responsibility!

The ``diff-cover`` command line tool compares an XML coverage report
with the output of ``git diff``.  It then reports coverage information
for lines in the diff.

Currently, ``diff-cover`` requires that:

- You are using ``git`` for version control.
- Your test runner generates coverage reports in Cobertura XML format.

Cobertura XML coverage reports can be generated with many coverage tools,
including:

- Cobertura__ (Java)
- coverage.py__ (Python)
- JSCover__ (JavaScript)

__ http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/
__ http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/
__ http://tntim96.github.io/JSCover/


``diff-cover`` is designed to be extended.  If you are interested
in adding support for other version control systems or coverage
report formats, see below for information on how to contribute!


Installation
------------

To install the latest release:

.. code:: bash

    pip install diff_cover


To install the development version:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/Bachmann1234/diff-cover.git
    cd diff-cover
    python setup.py install


Getting Started
---------------

1. Set the current working directory to a ``git`` repository.

2. Run your test suite under coverage and generate a Cobertura XML report.
   For example, if you are using `nosetests`__ and `coverage.py`__:

.. code:: bash

    nosetests --with-coverage
    coverage xml

__ http://nose.readthedocs.org
__ http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/

This will create a ``coverage.xml`` file in the current working directory.

**NOTE**: If you are using a different coverage generator, you will
need to use different commands to generate the coverage XML report.


3. Run ``diff-cover``:

.. code:: bash

    diff-cover coverage.xml

This will compare the current ``git`` branch to ``origin/master`` and print
the diff coverage report to the console.

You can also generate an HTML version of the report:

.. code:: bash

	diff-cover coverage.xml --html-report report.html

Multiple XML Coverage Reports
-------------------------------

In the case that one has multiple xml reports form multiple test suites, you
can get a combined coverage report (a line is counted  as covered if it is
covered in ANY of the xml reports) by running ``diff-cover`` with multiple
coverage reports as arguments. You may specify any arbitrary number of coverage
reports:

.. code:: bash

	diff-cover coverage1.xml coverage2.xml

Quality Coverage
-----------------
You can use diff-cover to see quality reports on the diff as well by running
``diff-quality``.

.. code :: bash

    diff-quality --violations=<tool>

Where ``tool`` is the quality checker to use. Currently ``pep8``, ``pyflakes``,
``flake8``, ``prospector``, and ``pylint`` are supported, but more checkers can
(and should!) be integrated.

Like ``diff-cover``, HTML reports can be generated with

.. code:: bash

    diff-quality --violations=<tool> --html-report report.html

If you have already generated a report using ``pep8``, ``pyflakes``, ``flake8``,
``prospector``, or ``pylint`` you can pass the report to ``diff-quality``.  This is more
efficient than letting ``diff-quality`` re-run ``pep8``, ``pyflakes``,
``flake8``, ``prospector``, or ``pylint``.

.. code:: bash

    # For pylint < 1.0
    pylint -f parseable > pylint_report.txt

    # For pylint >= 1.0
    pylint --msg-template="{path}:{line}: [{msg_id}({symbol}), {obj}] {msg}" > pylint_report.txt

    # Use the generated pylint report when running diff-quality
    diff-quality --violations=pylint pylint_report.txt

    # Use a generated pep8 report when running diff-quality.
    pep8 > pep8_report.txt
    diff-quality --violations=pep8 pep8_report.txt

Note that you must use the ``-f parseable`` option to generate
the ``pylint`` report for pylint versions less than 1.0 and the
``--msg-template`` option for versions >= 1.0.

``diff-quality`` will also accept multiple ``pep8``, ``pyflakes``, ``flake8``,
``prospector``, or ``pylint`` reports:

.. code:: bash

    diff-quality --violations=pylint report_1.txt report_2.txt

If you need to pass in additional options you can with the ``options`` flag

.. code:: bash

    diff-quality --violations=pep8 --options="--exclude='*/migrations*' --statistics" pep8_report.txt

Compare Branch
--------------

By default, ``diff-cover`` compares the current branch to ``origin/master``.  To specify a different compare branch:

.. code:: bash

    diff-cover coverage.xml --compare-branch=origin/release

Fail Under
----------

To have ``diff-cover`` and ``diff-quality`` return a non zero status code if the report quality/coverage percentage is
below a certain threshold specify the fail-under parameter

.. code:: bash

    diff-cover coverage.xml --fail-under=80
    diff-quality --violations=pep8 --fail-under=80

The above will return a non zero status if the coverage or quality score was below 80%

Troubleshooting
----------------------

**Issue**: ``diff-cover`` always reports: "No lines with coverage information in this diff."

**Solution**: ``diff-cover`` matches source files in the coverage XML report with
source files in the ``git diff``.  For this reason, it's important
that the relative paths to the files match.  If you are using `coverage.py`__
to generate the coverage XML report, then make sure you run
``diff-cover`` from the same working directory.

__ http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/

**Issue**: ``GitDiffTool._execute()`` raises the error:

.. code:: bash

    fatal: ambiguous argument 'origin/master...HEAD': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.

This is known to occur when running ``diff-cover`` in `Travis CI`__

__ http://travis-ci.org

**Solution**: Fetch the remote master branch before running ``diff-cover``:

.. code:: bash

    git fetch origin master:refs/remotes/origin/master

**Issue**: ``diff-quality`` reports "diff_cover.violations_reporter.QualityReporterError: No config file found, using default configuration"

**Solution**: Your project needs a `pylintrc` file. Provide this file (it can be empty) and ``diff-quality`` should run without issue.

**Issue**: ``diff-quality`` reports "Quality tool not installed"

**Solution**: ``diff-quality`` assumes you have the tool you wish to run against your diff installed. If you do not have it
then install it with your favorite package manager.

Setting Up For Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

diff-cover is written to support many versions of python. The best way to set
your machine up for development is to make sure you have ``tox`` installed which
can be installed using ``pip``.

.. code:: bash

    pip install tox

Now by simply running ``tox`` from the project root you will have environments
for all the supported python versions. These will be in the ``.tox`` directory.

To create a specific python dev environment just make a virtualenv for your python
version and then install the appropriate test-requirements file.

For example, setting up python 3:

.. code:: bash

    pyvenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r test-requirements-py27-py3.txt
