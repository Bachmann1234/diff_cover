        :param str range_notation:
            which range notation to use when producing the diff for committed
            files against another branch.

            Traditionally in git-cover the symmetric difference (three-dot, "A...M") notation has been used: it
            includes commits reachable from A and M from their merge-base, but not both, taking history in account.
            This includes cherry-picks between A and M, which are harmless and do not produce changes, but might give
            inaccurate coverage false-negatives.

            Two-dot range notation ("A..M") compares the tips of both trees and produces a diff. This more accurately
            describes the actual patch that will be applied by merging A into M, even if commits have been
            cherry-picked between branches. This will produce a more accurate diff for coverage comparison when
            complex merges and cherry-picks are involved.
