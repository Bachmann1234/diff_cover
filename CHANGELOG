* The fix from 4.2.0 was incorrect

* Just a point release to get back into the habit of signing them

12/11/2019 v2.5.0
 
 * Diff quality now has a plugin system! From now own this project will avoid adding new tools and instead direct those to become plugins instead. Perhaps we can look into moving existing tools into separate plugins over time however, currently im leaving it alone. Thank you @barrywhart (https://github.com/Bachmann1234/diff_cover/pull/128)

11/20/2019 v2.4.1

6/13/2019 v2.2.0

 * Add --version flag to both commands. Shocked we never had this

6/3/2019 v2.1.0

 * New option that controls how the patch is obtained: `--diff-range-notation`, defaulting to `...`.

   Traditionally in git-cover the symmetric difference (three-dot, "A...M") notation has been used: it includes
   commits reachable from A and M from their merge-base, but not both, taking history in account. This includes cherry-picks
   between A and M, which are harmless and do not produce changes, but might give inaccurate coverage false-negatives.

   Two-dot range notation ("A..M") compares the tips of both trees and produces a diff. This more
   accurately describes the actual patch that will be applied by merging A into M, even if commits have been
   cherry-picked between branches. This will produce a more accurate diff for coverage comparison when complex
   merges and cherry-picks are involved. Thanks @nicoddemus!

 * Fix for windows users! We were not properly normalizing paths causing source lines not to line up properly. Thanks @kingchad1989

5/10/2019 v2.0.1
