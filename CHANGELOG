6/13/2019 v2.2.0

 * Add --version flag to both commands. Shocked we never had this

6/3/2019 v2.1.0

 * New option that controls how the patch is obtained: `--diff-range-notation`, defaulting to `...`.

   Traditionally in git-cover the symmetric difference (three-dot, "A...M") notation has been used: it includes
   commits reachable from A and M from their merge-base, but not both, taking history in account. This includes cherry-picks
   between A and M, which are harmless and do not produce changes, but might give inaccurate coverage false-negatives.

   Two-dot range notation ("A..M") compares the tips of both trees and produces a diff. This more
   accurately describes the actual patch that will be applied by merging A into M, even if commits have been
   cherry-picked between branches. This will produce a more accurate diff for coverage comparison when complex
   merges and cherry-picks are involved. Thanks @nicoddemus!
